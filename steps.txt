1. dropping branch code and birth year columns ------> no value added
2. dropping nominee income columns -----> many null values
3. filling Max_Perc_Def_Chg_Pending [21078], Max_Ratio_OC_Pending_POS [72646] with zero -------> assumption and common sense
4. filling all other columns to zero -------> unable to find a better way to deal yet
5. changing target values from "yes" and "no" to 0 and 1 ------> for more concrete classification
6. scaling using minmaxscaler or standard scaler -------->  for better results
7. using K-fold to find accuracy --------> raw method applied need to be improved
8. splitting data -------> to make sure of our model efficiency
9. defining class weights for our logistic model -------> to make sure 1's are being considered thoroughly 
10. confusion matrix study and optimization --------> for precision
11. classification report study and optimization ---------> for recall particularly senstivity
12. oversampling -------> for making each sample size equal
13. Ensembling
14. regularization






one hot encoding 
filling in a better way

in certain columns 1's are prevailing when columns are 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.33, 0.75, 1.0
